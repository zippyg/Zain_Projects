# Portfolio Risk Management System

**Status: IN PROGRESS**

## Project Overview

The Portfolio Risk Management System (PRMS) is a C++ application designed to quantify, monitor, and mitigate risks in financial portfolios. It calculates key risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and performs stress testing to evaluate potential losses in extreme market conditions.

## Key Components and Methods

- **Data Acquisition:**
  - Financial Market Data APIs (Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters)
  - Boost.Asio for Asynchronous Networking

- **Risk Calculation Techniques:**
  - QuantLib Library for risk metrics
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Armadillo for matrix operations

- **Machine Learning:**
  - TensorFlow C++ API
  - Regression models, clustering, decision trees

- **Concurrency and Multithreading:**
  - `std::thread` and `std::async`

- **Database and Storage:**
  - PostgreSQL or MongoDB

- **User Interface:**
  - Qt Framework for UI
  - Python integration for advanced graphics
